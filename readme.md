# ðŸŽ¯ Object Detection Projects with YOLOv8 and OpenCV

This repository is a collection of real-time object detection projects using YOLOv8 and OpenCV. Each subfolder represents a standalone project designed to solve a specific real-world problem like tracking vehicles, counting people, detecting poker hands, and more.

## ðŸ“¦ Project List

- **car-counter**: Detect and count vehicles using YOLO and SORT.
- **people_up_down_counter**: Monitor people moving up/down across a virtual line.
- **Poker Hand Detector**: Recognize poker cards and evaluate the best hand.
- **PPE Detection**: Detect safety gear (helmets, vests, etc.) using a custom model.
- **Running Yolo**: Simple test runner for YOLO models.
- **Yolo Webcam**: Real-time object detection using webcam input.
